Code source: https://github.com/jason71995/bigan/blob/master/train_cifar10.py

## Introduction
Implementation of [(2016) Adversarial Feature Learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09782)

ATTENTION:
The architectures and the hyperparameters in this project are not exactly same as the paper.

## Environment

```
python==3.6
tensorflow==2.0
```

## Results

Results at 200k iterations.
